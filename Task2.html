            <h3>MAPCON</h3>
            <p>S. Tiwari, A. K. Jaiswal, A. K. Singh and A. Dubey, ”Additively Manufactured Dielectric Meta- Lens Antenna for
                Millimeter-Wave 5G Base-Stations,” 2023 IEEE Microwaves, Antennas, and Propagation Conference (MAPCON),
                Ahmedabad, India, 2023
                This research paper presents a novel design and development of a compact 3D-printed Dielectric Meta-Lens (DML) antenna
                optimized for ultra-wideband operation in the millimeter-wave frequency range, specifically at 28 GHz. The DML structure is
                constructed using cylindrical dielectric unit cells arranged in a 20 × 20 array to achieve precise phase distribution on the lens
                aperture. Experimental assessments in an anechoic chamber demonstrate remarkable results, including a substantial 9 dB gain
                enhancement, a 34.4 percentage 3-dB gain bandwidth, and an impressive maximum aperture efficiency of 92 percentage. These
                f
                indings highlight the DML antenna’s potential for advancing millimeter-wave applications such as 5G communication systems
                and radar technology.</p>

            <h3> VHDL Designing of Washing Machine</h3>
            <p> The ”VHDL Designing of Washing Machine” project employs VHDL programming to create a digital model of a washing
                machine control system. It includes finite state machines, sensor integration, user interface simulation, and fault tolerance
                mechanisms, providing a comprehensive and efficient representation of the appliance’s functionality for educational and
                practical purposes.</p>
            <h3>  Smart Waste Management</h3>
            <p> The ”Smart Waste Management” project focuses on developing an intelligent system using cutting-edge technologies to
                optimize the collection and monitoring of waste. Incorporating IoT devices, sensors, and data analytics, the project aims to
                enhance efficiency, reduce environmental impact, and provide real-time insights for sustainable waste management practices.</p>
